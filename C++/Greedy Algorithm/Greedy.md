##Greedy Algorithm
This is using greedy strategy to guarantee that every operations result in partial best solution, and hence eventually achieve the best overall solution.  For example, Steph and James both like to eat apple, where Steph can eat five apples, while James can eat three. If there are unlimited number of apples, how many apples do they eat in total? 

*The greedy algorithm can be selected here is: everyone eats the most number of apples. This is the partial best solution on everyone, and in this case the overall best solution is simply just the sum of the partial best solutions, and the partial solution is independent of each other, so the partial best solution is the overall best solution here.*
